    desc: >
      You promise it's only this messy because you just got up!
    take: >
      It's bolted to the wall.
    take_chance: 0
    use: >
      It is still warm, and so comfy.
      You guess you didn't have anything important to do anyway.

  - &garbage:
    alt: ["garbage pile"]
    desc: >
      The pile is only partially collapsed and remains precarious.
    take: >
      And what, put a giant pile of trash in my pocket?

  - &desk:
    desc: >
      Your desk, comparatively uncluttered but with a worn spot
      where you normally rest your head. You see your water bottle,
      a sandwich, and a mechanical engineering textbook.
      Below the desk is your trash can.
    take: >
      It's bolted to the floor.

  - &water:
    alt: ["water bottle", "bottle"]
    desc: >
      Your trusty water bottle. It is covered with anime stickers.
      You could probably remove the bottle,
      and the stickers would still be watertight.
    take: >
      Why would you want to keep that on your person in your own room?

  - &sandwich:
    desc: >
      A sandwich of uncertain provenance. There are no visible signs of danger.
    take: >
      Doesn't really seem very handy to carry around.

  - &textbook:
    alt: ["mechanical engineering textbook"]
    desc: >
      A super boring textbook/sedative combo.
      Contains various diagrams and techniques for structural and mechanical engineering.
    take: >
      But it's heavy!

  - &trashcan:
    desc: >
      It is very full, ergo the garbage pile.
    take: >
      That sounds hazardous.

  &test test:
    desc: >
      You are standing next to your bed.
      You see your desk and the garbage pile.
      To the East lies your roommate's area.
      To the South lies the door to the hallway (and showers).
