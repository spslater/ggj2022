bed:
    Look: You promise it's only this messy because you just got up!
    Take: It's bolted to the wall.
    Use: It is still warm, and so comfy. You guess you didn't have anything important to do anyway. GAME OVER

garbage pile:
    Look: The pile is only partially collapsed and remains precarious.
    Take: And what, put a giant pile of trash in my pocket?
    Use: For what, exactly?

desk:
    Look: Your desk, comparatively uncluttered but with a worn spot where you normally rest your head. You see your water bottle, a sandwich, and a mechanical engineering textbook. Below the desk is your trash can.
    Take: It's bolted to the floor.
    Use: The bed is comfier.

water bottle:
    Look: Your trusty water bottle. It is covered with anime stickers. You could probably remove the bottle, and the stickers would still be watertight.
    Take: Why would you want to keep that on your person in your own room?
    Use: You take a long pull of lukewarm water. You must have been dehydrated because your headache dissipates and your head clears. You remember that you have a dresser! [This sets a "Hydrated" flag.]

sandwich:
    Look: A sandwich of uncertain provenance. There are no visible signs of danger.
    Take: Doesn't really seem very handy to carry around.
    Use: You take a big bite and immediately realize that not all dangers are visible. Without even getting a chance to swallow, you are doomed. GAME OVER

textbook (or mechanical engineering textbook):
    Look: A super boring textbook/sedative combo. Contains various diagrams and techniques for structural and mechanical engineering.
    Take: But it's heavy!
    Use: Against all odds, you already finished that homework. Strictly speaking.

trashcan:
    Look: It is very full, ergo the garbage pile.
    Take: That sounds hazardous.
    Use: That ship has sailed.




 water bottle (Hydrated):
Use: You are no longer thirsty. That Megumin sticker is cute, though!



Look/take/use dresser (not Hydrated):
What dresser? [This is different from the standard unsupported command responses, so it could be a clue.]

Look dresser (Hydrated):
A utilitarian dorm dresser, attached to the wall.

Take dresser (Hydrated):
It's literally attached to the wall.

Use dresser (Hydrated):
Searching through the dresser's mostly barren drawers (standing on the rug made of dirty laundry in front of it), you find a phenomenal treasure: a clean towel! [This sets flag "TowelFound".]

Look towel (TowelFound):
A pristine, possibly never-used cheap blue towel from Target.

Use towel (TowelFound):
You're perfectly dry.

Take towel (TowelFound):
You drape the towel over your neck. Towel acquired! [This clears TowelFound and adds TowelHeld.]

Look/use towel (TowelHeld):
Same as above.

Take towel (TowelHeld):
You are already holding the towel.

[This is it for your side when you start. Now we do the other side.]

Move East:
You walk over to your roommate's area of the room. It is completely pristine, like an architecture magazine. You see her bed, her desk, and her dresser.

Look bed:
Her bed is perfectly made. You are nervous to stand next to it for fear of messing it up by causing air currents.

Look desk:
Her desk is spotless and has nothing on it. You dare not change either of those facts. Under the desk is her trashcan.

Look dresser:
She would kill you if you went through those drawers. On top you see two meticulously folded towels.

Take bed:
It's attached to the wall, and your roommate's hands would be attached to your throat if you messed it up.

Take desk:
It's bolted to the floor, and what would you even do with it?

Take dresser:
It's bolted to the wall, and too heavy anyway.

Use bed:
It's as good a death bed as any, but I'd rather live.

Use desk:
There's nothing on it!

Use dresser:
I dare not.

Look towel (or towels):
They are perfectly folded and fluffy from the laundry.

Use towel (or towels):
You're completely dry, and also you don't want to be stabbed when she gets home.

Take towel (or towels):
You reach for the towels, then have a panic attack imagining what she will do to you when she gets home. Your poor heart cannot take it. GAME OVER

Look trashcan:
It is empty and strangely clean. It's almost asking to be filled.

Use trashcan:
I don't have any trash to put in it.

Take trashcan:
You grab the trashcan. Maybe you can do some cleaning up. [This adds flag TrashHeld.] 
//add trashcan to inventory  

[This is it for the roommate's area. With the trashcan, you can do more stuff on your side.]

Go West:
[Repeat the same description, but add that you can see the dresser if they have the Hydrated flag, both here and if they use "look" after they have it.]

Use trashcan (TrashHeld): //if trash in inventory 
Use it with what?

Use trashcan with garbage pile (TrashHeld):
It will surely collapse and kill me. If only there were a method to dismantle it safely... 
[Set flag NeedMethod] //bool TrashCleared == F

Use textbook (NeedMethod): 
Use it with what?

Use textbook with garbage pile (NeedMethod):
Of course, practical application of your education! Using diagrams from the book, you devise a plan to dismantle the pile safely. [Clear NeedMethod, add HaveMethod]

Use trashcan (HaveMethod): 
Use it with what?

Use trashcan with garbage pile (HaveMethod):
You carefully dismantle the pile and place its contents into your roommate's trashcan. Underneath, you spot an old friend from bygone days: your shampoo! [Clear flag HaveMethod, add flag TrashGone]

[Change all garbage pile commands to "The pile has been removed." with TrashGone.]

Look shampoo:
A half-full bottle of shampoo. It originally had matching conditioner after a particularly ambitious trip to the drug store, but you left it behind in the bathroom once and decided it was probably for the best.

Use shampoo:
With what, the water bottle?

Use shampoo with water bottle:
That was a joke.

Take shampoo:
You grab the shampoo triumphantly! [Add flag ShampooHeld.]

[Now for the South door.]

Go South (nothing):
The hot water might wake you up, but your lack of anything to clean or dry yourself with does present an issue.

Go South (TowelHeld, no ShampooHeld):
You feel disgusting. You need more than just a rinse. You need a surfactant of some kind. And to burn the textbook that taught you that word, but one thing at a time.

Go South (ShampooHeld, no TowelHeld):
As deep as your craving for cleanliness is, drip-drying down the hallway is not a good way to make friends. Neither is slipping in your own puddle and breaking your neck, which is honestly the most likely scenario.

Go South (TowelHeld and ShampooHeld):
You journey into the great beyond. Once you are clean and dry, you can get to work on figuring out what day of the week it is!
